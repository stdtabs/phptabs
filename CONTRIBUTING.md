Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Issues
------

Before creating an issue, please read the
[Phptabs Manual](https://phptabs.readthedocs.io).

Sometimes, answers are not as fast as you/we expected. This is why there 
is a __maximum delay__ between 2 comments.

### 10-day delay

- PhpTabs team has 10 days to answer a question
- You have 10 days to answer a question, add another information or 
  close an issue.

Because you/we are human, the 10-day delay can be exceeded.

In this case, a raise can be made with a simple ping comment.

### Ping comment

- A ping comment MUST contain a __[Ping comment]__ mention.
- After a ping, a new 10-day delay is triggered. 

### Timeout comment

- If there is no return after a ping comment, the team can close the
ticket with a __[Timeout comment]__.
- This type of comment is restricted to the PhpTabs team.

### Notes

- You/we can obviously reopen a closed issue.

- You/we can explicitly indicate that the next interaction will act in 
more than 10 days.
